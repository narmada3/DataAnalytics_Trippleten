# File Title: Fresh Beats Status Report

This was an optional project I worked on after the TripleTen Business Intelligence Analytics Program. It was a junior-level project to turn an analysis into a report presentation.

Fresh Beats is a music streaming platform catering to listeners and up-and-coming musicians. It offers music streaming and helps new artists gain exposure through promotional services.
The platform faces challenges in optimizing these areas:

- Ensuring artist promotions are effective and deliver value for musicians.
- Converting free listeners into paying subscribers.
- Recommending music effectively, especially for highlighting new artists in relevant genres.

#### Data:
The data was one Google spreadsheet file provided by TripleTen:
- `'sprint 0  BIA Welcome Sprint Project. Fresh Beats User Data'`: each row corresponds to one cross-dimensional category.
    - `'year'`: year data was obtained for each dimension
    - `'user_tier'`: Boolean data categorizing if the users were Free or Paid Subscribers
    - `'genre'`: specifies a string of data for the type of genre that was listened to
    - `'number_of_users'`: The SUM of all users for each dimension
    - `'tracks_listened'`: The SUM of all music plays for each dimension

A Google Doc with a template for the project was provided. Blank Sections included:
- `'Summary'`

- `'Recommendations'`
- `'Visualizations'`
- `'Conclusion'`

#### Assumptions:
- Data Availability: The project assumes that all the necessary data for analyzing user engagement and business challenges is available in the provided dataset spreadsheet.

#### Findings:

User Engagement and Conversion:
- Paid users are more engaged: They listen to more music and show better retention. Converting free users to paid subscribers is a key strategy.
- Genre preferences differ: Rock is popular with free users, while Indie is popular with paid users. Tailoring recommendations based on user type can improve engagement.
