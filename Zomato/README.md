# File Title: Zomato Customer Analysis

This was my Final project for the TripleTen Business Intelligence Analytics Program. It was an independent project designed to showcase what I have learned throughout the TripleTen Program. The purpose was to complete the Zomato onboarding project to showcase analytical skills to the mock company.

#### Description:
- This was a Customer Segmentation Analysis.
- 2 pages in Power BI.
- Includes KPI cards, Pie charts, bar charts, and RFM analysis.

#### Process:
I first learned of the problem presented in its entirety and its requirements for approval.
Then, I chose software and created my first submission, the "Decomposition Plan".
After, I analyzed the data and created visualizations and dashboards for a second submission.
Lastly, I presented my findings in a report as my 3rd and final submission piece.

#### Data
TripleTen provided an archived file of 5 separate Excel files from the mock company Zomato. I used 2 for this project.
- `'Zomato data.zip'`: Compressed Excel files provided by team lead
    - `'orders'`: All orders made from the menu by all customers at all restaurants between Oct. 4th, 2017, and June 26th, 2020.
    - `'users'`: All customers who completed orders during the designated time frame and their demographic information.
- `'Measures Table'`: Created table for analysis and to maintain the integrity of original files. Housing all used measures.
- `'Calendar'`: Created table for analysis and to maintain the integrity of original files. Housing all date information for potential calculations.
- `'Segmentations'`: Created table for analysis and to maintain the integrity of original files. Housing all segments and RFM scores needed for inclusion.
- `'RFM Table'`: Created table for analysis and to maintain the integrity of original files. Housing all RFM calculations.

#### Assumptions:
- The provided test datasets are accurate, complete, and consistent.
- Missing values or inconsistencies are minimal and will not significantly impact the analysis.
- The column descriptions accurately reflect the content of each table.
- The provided tables (orders and users) contain all the necessary information for the chosen analysis.
- Zomato's business context and industry trends are considered while interpreting the data.

#### Findings:
1. Customers mostly consist of 23-year-old unmarried men.
2. There is a natural distribution for age however the range is small at 18-34.
3. Women are close behind, but there are significantly more customers who are single than married.
4. Zomatoâ€™s customers usually have small family sizes (2-3), educated, but unemployed.
5. Employed customers tend to be below middle class ($50,000/yr).
